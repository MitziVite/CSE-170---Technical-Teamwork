<p><b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points)</b></p> 
I watch the TED video. <br><br>

<p><b>Why is this week's topic important? (5 points)</b></p>
Synergism is essential for teamwork because it is the way that each member of a team can use their skills to benefit the team. <br><br>

<p><b>What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</b></p><br>
What are the meaning of teaming and the things that confirm it<br><br>

<p><b>Why is this week's topic important? (5 points)</b></p><br>
Synergism is essential for teamwork because it is the way that each member of a team can use their skills to benefit the team. <br><br>

<p><b>What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p>
I enjoyed learning about teaming special about humility. Because the TED video taught me that to build an environment of Synergism, we need to be humble to understand that even when we think that we know what other people are trying to explain, we need to be humble enough to try to learn from that.  <br>

<p><b> What concept from this week are you uncertain of, or would you like to know more about?(10 points)</b></p>
I would like to continue learning more about Synergism because I still don't understand it very well.<br><br>

<p><b>How would you explain this week's topics to a person, not in this class? (10 points)</b></p>
I will tell him that Synergism is the cooperation produced between a team where the combination of both parts gives a more significant result than if just one of them works on it.<br><br>

 <p><b> What would you do differently next week? (10 points)</b></p>
 Next week I don't have classes anymore, but I want to continue applying the things I have learned in this class throughout my life. </b></p>

 <p><b>Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn't know before? (20 points)</b></p>
 I taught my friend about what is Synergism and how you can develop it. She said that something interesting for her was humility and that she had never thought about that, but it makes a lot of sense. She learned that humility is the basis of being a better team player.
<br><br>
<p><b>Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b></p>
Understanding synergism can help a team to know the importance of cooperation and humility. Because some problems in a teamwork environment can be because of the lack of humility or empathy for others. 
<br><br>

<p><b>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points)</b></p>
While watching the TED video, I remembered the scriptures in Ether 12:27 that say: "27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give men weakness that they may be humble, and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things strong unto them.". To have Synergism in a team, each member needs to be humble, and as we can see in the scriptures, if we humble ourselves, we will be stronger.
