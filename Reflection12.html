<h1> Reflection #12 </h1>

<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                         Total Points: 100 points</h3>

<p><b> What concept from this week are you uncertain of or would like to know more about? (5 points)</b></p> 
I would like to learn about loyalty in generation Z. <br><br>

<p><b>What phase of your projects did you complete? (5 points)</b></p>
We finished the task of Sound Thinkers, effective communicators, and skilled collaborators.<br><br>

<p><b> What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</b></p><br>
I knew that being loyal to a company has changed throughout the years, and nowadays is well seen if someone doesn't work a lot of time in a company. Also, it is more important to be loyal to yourself than to a company or coworkers. And there is a greater chance of getting better jobs if you change it frequently.<br><br>

<p><b>What did you learn from your work on your project? (5 points)</b></p><br>
I knew that we needed to use the skills to help our team. Also, a team is for helping one another to accomplish a common goal. I learned that time management is essential, and we must take care of it.<br><br>

<p><b>What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p>
I learned that there are three different kinds of loyalty: obedience, balance, and free agency. I learned that each is necessary for certain circumstances and knowing about them can help us choose which one we want to live in certain parts of our lives. <br>

<p><b> What did you learn by explaining this week's topic to someone, not in this class? (10 points)</b></p>
I will say that loyalty has different faces, and we need to learn to differentiate when we need to be wholly loyal or not. For example, if you believe in something, you must be devoted to defending and living that. But you don't need to be loyal to a company just because you signed a contract if you have better opportunities or don't feel comfortable there.<br><br>

<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b></p>
Loyalty is crucial for cooperation because if we have the perspective that the people in our team are just objects that we can use to accomplish a goal, that will create the same thought for everyone, and that can provoke the team to be not united. People change their job before finishing the time of a contract or are not committed to doing their best.<br><br>

 <p><b> How do you plan on contributing to the team besides completing your tasks? (20 points)</b></p>
 I will prepare the things I am going to say for the presentation, and I will help them to do the presentation and answer their questions as fast as possible. </b></p>

 <p><b>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points) </b></p>
 Loyalty is an attribute of Jesus Christ; we must be loyal to our friends, family, the gospel, and ourselves. We need to be dedicated to our beliefs and be an example and a light to others. When we do our best to be loyal to the Lord, he will help us to fulfill our potential and allow us to be more successful than we, with our efforts, can have. When we live the principles of the gospel and are loyal to the Lord and our family, we will be happier and feel that the Lord is with us fighting our battles.
