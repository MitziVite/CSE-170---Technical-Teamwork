<p><b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p>
I learned that it is good to make your voice heard, and I realized that disagreeing with others is not bad. Instead, it could be helpful and healthier. Conflicts are necessary for teamwork to get to the best solutions. Moreover, knowing how to abord them is crucial to help people understand your point of view and get to agreements.<br><br>

<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b></p>
Leadership is one of the most excellent skills we can develop to help our teams because we need leadership to succeed in our tasks and projects. We need it to inspire and motivate our team. Also, to organize our team and give the direction of the perspective and things we need to do. And, we need it to help our coworkers to have union even though there are personality differences. <br><br>

 <p><b> How do you plan on contributing to the team besides completing your tasks? (20 points)</b></p>
 This week I managed better my time to be accessible on Thursday evening. I also provided refreshments to give motivation to my team. And I tried to plan the next meeting.</b></p>

 <p><b>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points) </b></p>
 While reading the preparation material, I remembered the scripture in 3 Nephi 27:27 that says:" what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am." I learned that if we want to be great leaders, we need to follow the example of Jesus Christ because he has been the most outstanding leader in the world. 
That means we must live his gospel and be diligent in trying to emulate his example and develop his attributes.
