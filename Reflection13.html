<h1> Reflection #13 </h1>

<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                         Total Points: 100 points</h3>

<p><b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points)</b></p> 
I studied the presentation we gave this Monday and watched a Ted Talk about personality called Who are you, really? The puzzle of nature.<br><br>

<p><b>What phase of your projects did you complete? (5 points)</b></p>
We made the presentation and the takeaways of each project.<br><br>

<p><b> What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</b></p><br>
I understand that everyone has a personality that makes them unique, but also there are similar. <br><br>

<p><b>WWhy is this week's topic important? (5 points)</b></p><br>
Each person has their personality, and sometimes, in the work environment can be a conflict between some characters. That is why we need to help our teams act with professionalism so we can collaborate even though these differences exist.<br><br>

<p><b>
    What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p>
    Even though I have an introverted personality, that doesn't mean that I can't succeed in my goals in those where I need others to achieve them. Because of my character, I can help my teams in a particular way, which is essential to my team. <br>

<p><b> How would you explain this week's topics to a person, not in this class? (10 points)</b></p>
I will tell him that personality is the fusion of characteristics and qualities in a person. Each person has a different personality that makes them unique, but there are similarities between one person's personality and another. Because of these differences, there can be conflicts in a team, but also there can be great opinions and ideas because of the union of these personalities. <br><br>

<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b></p>
Understanding personalities can be conducive to having more success in a team. Because if we understand the things where people are better at, or the likes or dislikes can help us to distribute the tasks better, making the work more enjoyable and dynamic. Also, knowing our coworkers' personalities can help us have more union and avoid differences in personalities. <br><br>

 <p><b> How would you phrase your experience as a STAR story if you were to write it? (20 points)</b></p>
 While serving a mission, I was a companion with one sister. We were very different in personality. I needed to teach her to be a missionary, but we often had verbal fights. But when we understood that our goal was the same, we started putting aside those differences and tried to understand each other and be patient when necessary. After some time, we started having success, surpassing the mission's goals, and becoming excellent friends. </b></p>

 <p><b>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points) </b></p>
 I like a quote by Elder Dallin H. Oaks: "Differences are inevitableâ€”some minor and some major. Regarding major differences, suppose a family member is in a cohabitation relationship." 
In our lives, we are going to know a lot of different people inside the church and outside of it, and sometimes we are going to have conflicts with them because we don't agree with certain beliefs or differences in personalities. Jesus Christ has taught us that contention is not of God, so if we follow Christ, we will do everything in our hands to love those who are difficult to love for us.
