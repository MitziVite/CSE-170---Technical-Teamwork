<h1> Reflection #10</h1>

<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                     Total Points: 100 points</h3>

<p><b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </b></p> 
I read the preparation material, and I also plan my week so I can have time to join my team and complete the part of the project we need to do for this week.<br><br>

<p><b>What concept from this week are you uncertain of or would like to know more about? (5 points)</b></p>
I want to learn how I can develop these skills. Are there apps? Or in the school is there a place that can help you? <br><br>

<p><b> What topics were studied this week, and what are their definitions? (5 points)</b></p><br>
hola

<br><br>

<p><b>Where did you put your assignments on GitHub? (5 points)</b></p>
This week I put them in my repository inside of the folder CSE-170---Technical-Teamwork <br>

<p><b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p>
One of my favorite quotes from the preparation material was: "Corporations with excellent communication networks are successful in their business whereas corporations with poor communication networks are disasters." I think this quote emphasizes the importance of good communication in teamwork. If a company has good communication, the time they use to do a project is more effective and enjoyable.<br><br>

<p><b> How would you explain this week's topics to a person, not in this class? (10 points) </b></p>
I would explain to him the different kinds of communication that exist. I would tell him that good communication skills are essential for teamwork, so there can be fewer misunderstandings and better use of time. I would also explain the importance of ethical communication to work in a healthy work environment.<br><br>

 <p><b>Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b></p>
 I think that because this skill is one of the most important that companies are asking for their employees, it should be crucial. In the preparation material, we learn that a communication network is known to be from top to bottom. Still, we need to also learn the importance of communication from the bottom to the top. 
 While we work in a team, we need to understand the importance of the different kinds of communication, and we need to develop our abilities in them, which are: verbal, public speaking, written communication, and digital communication.
 <br><br>

 <p><b> How do you plan on contributing to the team besides completing your tasks? (20 points)</b></p>
 This week, even though I have planned some different activities that I need to do, I will change them so I can work on the projects we need to do for this week. Also, I am going to give more of my opinion and participate actively in the discussions and ideas brainstorms.<br><br>

 <p><b>If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel? (20 points)</b></p>
 I was thinking about the importance of the prophets. They speak face to face with the Lord, and they are the ones who tell us what the Lord wants us to do, so they need to be clear and precise in their words. They need excellent communication skills, and the Holy Spirit helps them remember and preach the gospel. One of my favorite quotes is in Doctrine and Covenants 1:38 38 "What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by own mine voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same." Because it teaches us about the relationship, God has with His prophets and what we should do when we hear them.
