<h1> Reflection #8</h1>

<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                     Total Points: 100 points</h3>

<p><b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </b></p> 
Before this week started, I read most of the preparation material and tried to explain it to my family. <br><br>

<p><b>What phase of your projects did you complete? (5 points)</b></p>
This week we were worried about our grade in our Proposal Acorn Project Final. So, we were waiting for the approval. As a team, we made some corrections to the project so it could accomplish the requirements. <br><br>

<p><b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p><br>
Competition between employees may be an inescapable part of many people's work lives and can lead to improved performance. But if leaders want to ensure that competition unleashes creativity and not unethical behavior, they must resist the temptation to rule through fear.
While reading this paragraph, I thought I would like to work in environments where the competition is healthy and helps me to be a better employee. And if I cannot work in this environment, I would like to remember who I am so I can do the right things even in this environment.<br><br>

<p><b>What would you do differently next week? (10 points)</b></p>
For the next week, I would like to organize my schedule better so it can match with my team's program and we can continue doing the projects. <br>

<p><b> What five take did you get from the scenerio? (10 points)</b></p>
Something I like from the scenario of this week was the example of how the three friends acted. I would not want to be like them because they started being toxic and hiding things from each other, which made their friendship collapse, and they betrayed each other.  <br><br>

<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b></p>
This topic is essential for teamwork, because there is always going to be competition in our jobs, and we need to learn the difference between a competition that is good and one that is not. So, we can be prepared in the way that we are going to act. And how we are going to interact with our co-workers. And what are we willing to do to achieve the goals. <br><br>

 <p><b> How would you phrase your experience as STAR story if you were to write it? (20 points)</b></p>
 In my high school, each year, they did a competition where all the students needed to show a project, and the best ones could be sold to some companies or could gain a scholarship. Sometimes this environment turns toxic, and some students steal the ideas of others. With my team, I tried to help them relax and remember that if we did our best but didn't win, we should also celebrate and place that was the only thing we needed to do. This mindset helped us finish our projects on time and be selected as one of the best ones, and our task was sold to a school. <br><br>
 <p><b> If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel? (20 points)</b></p>
 I like one scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19 "18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
 19 And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." 
 Because, indeed, we are not better than others, it reminds me of the importance of always trying my best and having the desire always to learn, so I can be a little better prepared when we live with our Heavenly Father.  <br><br>
