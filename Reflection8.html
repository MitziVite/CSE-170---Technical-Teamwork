<h1> Reflection #8</h1>
<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                     Total Points: 100 points</h3>
<p><b> What phase of your projects did you complete? (5 points) </b></p> 
This week we modify our acorn project for the final approval. I checked it and modified a part of it. <br><br>
<p><b>Why is this week's topic important? (5 points)</b></p>
It is important to know what to do in a moment when there is conflict in our team or our project. And help others to overcome it. <br><br>
<p><b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p><br>
I learn that is good to make your voice heard, I learned that to disagree with others is not bad. Instead, it could be helpful and healthier. Conflicts are important and necessary in teamwork to get to the best solutions. Moreover, it is important to know how to abord them to help people understand your point of view and get to agreements.<br><br>
<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b></p>
One of the quotes that I liked most from the lecture was:” Conflict allows the team to come to terms with difficult situations, to synthesize diverse perspectives, and to make sure solutions are well thought-out,” Because it summarizes the importance of conflict in teamwork. It helps us to get to solutions where the majority agrees.
When we understand that conflict is necessary, we can have higher job satisfaction and better relationships. It also gives you the opportunity to learn and grow.  
 <br><br>
<p><b> How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks? (20 points)</b></p>
This week I am planning to pay more attention to the emails of my team so I can answer faster, in this way I could help more efficiently. Also, even though is difficult for me to express myself I want to give more ideas to my team and share my perspective, even if that involves conflict.  <br>
<p><b> Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn’t know before? (20 points)</b></p>
I taught my parents about the importance of conflict, and they told me that It is true that in every relationship there is always going to be differences between opinions, but if they work as a team they can have a strong basis. Also, when there are conflicts there can be more knowledge and understanding. They also learned that everybody has different opinions and that is awesome and is necessary that each member share their points of view so they can have a better result. <br><br>
<p><b> If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20 points)</b></p>
While I was reading the preparation material, I remembered the scripture of 2 Nephi 2:11 “For it must needs be, that there is an opposition all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.”
Sometimes when we disagree with others' opinions, we need to learn that that is completely fine. Is good to have different ideas and perspectives. Because as the scripture explains there is necessary to have opposition in all things. 
Something very important is to learn how to deal with it. We need to be respectful and remember that they are our brothers and sisters, so we can show them that we love them and while we speak, we can be careful with our words and actions.
